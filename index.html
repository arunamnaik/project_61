    <h1>about</h1>
    <section id="welcome"><p>I love doing cycling, i do it everyday. I usually go down cycling at 6:00 pm due to the cool breeze in the evening. Cycling is an exercise which helps in growing one"s height with energy due to consumption of food. If you ever want a cycle i reccomend using training wheels as you won't get it on the first try. Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport. People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists", "bicyclists", or "bikers". Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles. Thank you!-Avyukt Naik.</p></section>
